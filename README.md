# Portfolio

## This is my own website - designed to focus on its great performance and functionality on the back end, while being housed in a modest, unassuming design. This site performs certain functions such as signing up to create a profile, the ability to make posts with a photo, like and comment on posts, edit or delete posts, as well as, editing and deleting, and signing out. This website is still under construction and further development until launch.


### Review:
### Built on **MERN** stack and using **RestFull API** style to provide a smooth and secure transition between pages. **NodeJs** is the back end build.
### *Efficient, Secure (passport), Reliable, Responsive, with Excellent Performance (Promise & callBack, Async Function)*, Bootstrap and 'awesome' font used for styling.
### I have used Mongodb as a database to create compatibility in MERN and get connected by Mongoose.
### Practiced some SASS and LESS with CSS3. 
### Package.Jason file edited to track the version, show the author, controlling dependencies and forcing versions.
